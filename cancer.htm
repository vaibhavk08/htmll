<h2 style="color= black"><b>Cancer</b></h2 >
<p style="color= white">Cancer is a broad term. It describes the disease that results when cellular changes cause the uncontrolled growth and division of cells.

Some types of cancer cause rapid cell growth, while others cause cells to grow and divide at a slower rate.

Certain forms of cancer result in visible growths called tumors, while others, such as leukemia, do not.

    <h1>Stages of Cancer</h1>
    <p>
      Doctors combine the T, N, M results and other factors specific to the cancer to determine the stage of cancer for each person. Most types of cancer have four stages: stages I (1) to IV (4). Some cancers also have a stage 0 (zero).</p>

<p><b>Stage 0.</b> This stage describes cancer in situ, which means “in place.” Stage 0 cancers are still located in the place they started and have not spread to nearby tissues. This stage of cancer is often highly curable, usually by removing the entire tumor with surgery.</p>

<p><b>Stage I.</b> This stage is usually a small cancer or tumor that has not grown deeply into nearby tissues. It also has not spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body. It is often called early-stage cancer.</p>

<p><b>Stage II and Stage III.</b> In general, these 2 stages indicate larger cancers or tumors that have grown more deeply into nearby tissue. They may have also spread to lymph nodes but not to other parts of the body.

<p><b>Stage IV.</b> This stage means that the cancer has spread to other organs or parts of the body. It may also be called advanced or metastatic cancer.</p>

  <h2>Breast Cancer</h2>
  <p>Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.
  </p>
  <p>After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.
  </p>
  <p>Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped create advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have increased, and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining, largely due to factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease.
  </p>
  <h4>Symptoms</h4>
  <p>Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:</p>
  <ul type="bullet">
    <li>A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue.
    </li>
    <li>Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast
    </li>
    <li>Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling
    </li>
    <li>A newly inverted nipple
    </li>
    <li>Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin
    </li>
     <li>Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange
     </li>
   </ul>

  <h2>Brain Cancer</h2>
  <img src="16.jpg" alt="flg" width="350" height="350" style="float: right;  padding: 2px; border: solid black 2px;">
  <p>A brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which have spread from elsewhere, known as brain metastasis tumors.</p>
  <p>Not all brain tumors cause symptoms, and some (such as tumors of the pituitary gland) are often not found unless a CT scan or MRI is done for another reason. The symptoms of brain cancer are numerous and not specific to brain tumors, meaning they can be caused by many other illnesses. </p>
   <p> The only way to know for sure what is causing the symptoms is to undergo diagnostic testing. Symptoms can be caused by:</p>
   <ul type="bullet">
     <li>A tumor pressing on or encroaching on other parts of the brain and keeping them from functioning normally.</li>
     <li>Swelling in the brain caused by the tumor or surrounding inflammation.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>the most common symptoms are:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Headache</li>
     <li>Weakness</li>
     <li>Clumsiness</li>
     <li>Difficulty Walking</li>
     <li>Seizure</li>

    <h2>Lung Cancer</h2>
    <img src="17.jpg" alt="flg" width="350" height="350" style="float: right;  padding: 2px; border: solid black 2px;">
    <p>Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs. Your lungs are two spongy organs in your chest that take in oxygen when you inhale and release carbon dioxide when you exhale.</p>
     <p>People who smoke have the greatest risk of lung cancer, though lung cancer can also occur in people who have never smoked. The risk of lung cancer increases with the length of time and number of cigarettes you've smoked. If you quit smoking, even after smoking for many years, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing lung cancer.</p>
    <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>
    <p>Lung cancer typically doesn't cause signs and symptoms in its earliest stages. Signs and symptoms of lung cancer typically occur only when the disease is advanced.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A new cough that doesn't go away</li>
      <li>Shortness of breath</li>
      <li>Chest pain</li>
      <li>Hoarseness</li>
      <li>Losing weight without trying</li>
      <li>Bone pain</li>

    <h2>Bladder Cancer</h2>
    <img src="18.jpg" alt="flg" width="250" height="250" style="float: right;  padding: 2px; border: solid black 2px;">
    <p>The bladder is a hollow, flexible pouch in your pelvis. Its main job is to store urine before it leaves your body. Your kidneys make pee. Tubes called ureters carry the pee from your kidneys to your bladder. When you use the bathroom, the muscles in your bladder push the urine out through a tube called the urethra.</p>
    <p>Bladder cancer symptoms include painless blood in the urine or frequent and painful urination. Bladder cancer is highly treatable with options such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.</p>
    <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>
    <p>Bladder cancer signs and symptoms may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blood in urine (hematuria)</li>
      <li>Painful urination</li>
      <li>Pelvic pain</li>
      <li>Back pain</li>

  <p>Cancer ribbons are a great way to raise awareness, but we have heard from people who are embarrassed when they do not recognize a particular colored ribbon. The good news is that most people are understanding if you do not know which ribbon color goes with which cancer, as there are a lot.
  </p>
  <p>there are different color of ribbon denotes the different cancer awareness. They are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>All Cancers: Light Purple (Lavender)</li>
