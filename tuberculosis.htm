  <h2>Tuberculosis</h2>
  <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a potentially serious infectious disease that mainly affects your lungs. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis are spread from one person to another through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes.
    </p>
 <p>Once rare in developed countries, tuberculosis infections began increasing in 1985, partly because of the emergence of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. HIV weakens a person's immune system so it can't fight the TB germs. In the United States, because of stronger control programs, tuberculosis began to decrease again in 1993, but remains a concern.

  <h2>Type of Tuberculosis</h2>
  <p>Doctors make a distinction between two kinds of tuberculosis infection: <b>latent and active</b>.</p>
  <p><b>Latent TB</b> - the bacteria remain in the body in an inactive state. They cause no symptoms and are not contagious, but they can become active.</p>
   <p><b>Active TB</b> - the bacteria do cause symptoms and can be transmitted to others.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="container3">
   <h2>Symptoms</h2>
   <p>While TB usually affects the lungs, it can also affect other parts of the body, and the symptoms will vary accordingly.
   </p>
  <p>Without treatment, TB can spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The bones: There may be spinal pain and joint destruction.</li>
    <li>The brain: It can lead to meningitis.</li>
    <li>The liver and kidneys: It can impair the waste filtration functions and lead to blood in the urine.</li>
    <li>The heart: It can impair the heart's ability to pump blood, resulting in cardiac tamponade, a condition that can be fatal.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
  <div class="treatment">
    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <p>The majority of TB cases can be cured when the right medication is available and administered correctly. The precise type and length of antibiotic treatment depend on a person's age, overall health, potential resistance to drugs, whether the TB is latent or active, and the location of infection (i.e., the lungs, brain, kidneys).
    </p>
    <p>TB medication can be toxic to the liver, and although side effects are uncommon, when they do occur, they can be quite serious. Potential side effects should be reported to a doctor and include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dark urine</li>
      <li>Fever</li>
      <li>Jaundice</li>
      <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    </ul>
