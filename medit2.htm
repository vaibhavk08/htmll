        <h2 style="text-align: center">Cancer</h2>
        <p>Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth
           with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.
          These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread to other
          parts of the body.
          There are more than 100 types of cancer, including breast cancer,
          skin cancer.</p>

      <div class="tuberculosis">
        <h2 style="text-align:center">Tuberculosis</h2>
        <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused
           by mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria.
          Tuberculosis (TB) is a potentially serious
          infectious disease that mainly affects your lungs. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis
          are spread from one person to another through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes.
          About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive
          while 5â€“10% of people in the United States population test positive
          by the tuberculin test.

      <div class="tumor">
        <h2 style="text-align: center">Tumors</h2>
        <p>A neoplasm is a type of abnormal and excessive growth, called neoplasia, of tissue.
          The growth of a neoplasm is uncoordinated with that of
          the normal surrounding tissue, and it persists growing abnormally,
           even if the original trigger is removed.
          This abnormal growth usually (but not always) forms a mass. When it
          forms a mass, it may be called a tumor. A neoplasm can be caused by an abnormal
          proliferation of tissues, which can be caused by genetic mutations.</p>
